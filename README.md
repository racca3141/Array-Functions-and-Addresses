# Array-Functions-and-Addresses

Write three useful functions that act on an array.
1. Write a function that takes in an array an populates it with random integers from 1 - 100.  Use the following function prototype.
void populateIntArray(int a[], int size);
2. Write a function that takes in an array and it's size and outputs the contents to the screen. Use the following function prototype.
void printArrayContents(int a[], int size);
3. Write a function that takes in an array and it's size and outputs the address of each element.
void printArrayAddresses(int a[], int size);
4. Demonstrate the usage of all these functions in the main. No user input (NO UI).
